* fix crystals

* cut notch in board for light sensors (removed traces, we cut manually)

* check polarity of the enable line on 1.8v audio LDO - should match power supply polarity i.e. low = disable

* fix pad 33 on the LED controller.  It should be a pin that we can connect to ground

* JTAG Cool routing (what does this mean?)

* move power LED and MSP430 LED - make pretty status light row

* re route radio

* tighten FTDI layout

* route audio circuit

* change layout of bridge rectifier

* clear ant placement with william

* symetrical sound chip layout

* check '138 pinout to 138 chip

* Radio Polygon

* make sch for expansion connector

* move light sensor

* Lock IR Beacons

* remove board cut-outs

* fix pins on '138

* check part footprint for C46, the the 2.2uf cap on the audio amp.  Is it the right size for a 2.2uf ceramic cap? (none in lab but ordered more of the 0603(1608) package

* order Samtec sudden samples of 8 & 10 pos connectors

* verify shift register footprint

* enlarge holes for screws - make pads 250mils

* check footprints for D1, D8, D29. 

* check audio amp data sheet for power pad


* check silkscreen on button switch - is it the right size?


* check silkscreen footprint on JTAG connector.  is it big enough? 

* move bypas caps on IR receivers to top layer


* make smaller amp part for audio amp - check data sheet for different package? no smaller size


* fix silkscreen for part for '138  and for the '595 the silk screen is too small: I merged the two TSSOP-16 parts to one footprint

* fix crystal part for sound chip - pins/pads not connected right, crystal should be on diagonal, and grouds on other diagonal

* order new crystals - unify all crystals to same manufactorer/type as much as possible
