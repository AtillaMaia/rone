roneMotorBoard-v14 ECO list

== TODO ==
* remove msp430 ground trace

 add LPF on MSP430 ground input

* Make sure vias are all tented correctly on bottom of the board


== DONE ==

* Move silkscreens of any labels away from the giant MRSL label. They are currently stuck inside it...

* Resistor divider on bottom board for sensing charge voltage needs to be 1/3, not 2/3 (2 MOhm on top, 1MOhm on bottom)

* Silkscreen fixes on bottom board

* Make sure all vias are tented on bottom board

* Fix mis-sized parts on bottom board (0603 on 0402, etc.)

* Make sure the next build is a V14, and make sure that V14 has all the changes
