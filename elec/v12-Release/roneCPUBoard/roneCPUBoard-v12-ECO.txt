roneCPUBoard-v11 ECO list

== Abandoned/Next Version ==

* make a four-layer board.

== Done ==

* Tent only the top side of the vias

* Cleanup weird kinks in traces (Figure out how to do a drc on them)

* Add markers for where the robot ID should go and make room for it.

* Add to the expansion connector: Another GND Pin, Another 3.3V pins, Another VBAT pin

* Ensure that the IR transmit and recive lines are always at right angles or far apart (cross-talk)

* update resistor values to production values?
	sound chip op amp
	LEDs
	LED controller

* Determine Final Speaker Connector Position --Right now, it is rotated oddly for the ammount of room it has. Consider rotating 90 -Jeremy

* Cleanup Ground
 
* Cleanup 3.3V

* Move and scale Rone Logo

* add open source hardware logo

* Silkscreen cleanup and revision

* Add LED_RESET line to the inter board connector and the LEDs. This reset comes from the MSP430. It allows the LEDs to be used by 
	the MSP while the motors, 8962, sound chip, and radio are held in reset. 

* Remove the Single Sided resistors for audio amplifyier

* Remove 5V_BOOST Line and just always power the Speaker from the battery.

* In the connector inbetween the boards, the 5V_BOOST line needs to become a second 5VUSB and the CHRGEN line needs to become FTDI_RESET.

* Add 4th light sensor

* Move the speaker connector to the V12 position

* move charge LED source from 3.3V to VBAT so that they work properly (bottom board too)

* change the diode bridge from 0.9A to 2A to support the new 1A charge current

* measure standby current draw

* Fix the SD card (Fixed by see below)

* add seperate ftdi reset line

* In order to fix the SD card, change the pullups on the MISO and MOSI lines to pull-ups instead of pull-downs.

* Move IR_Beacon to LED_HEartbeat pin (for PWM), Move LED_Heartbeat to CHRGEN pin, Remove CHRGEN

* how to charge when robot is off? hold reset low, poweren high? -Doesn't the robot already charge when off (at 100mA)? -Jeremy

* Look into interfacing with the expansion gumstix board UART with diodes -Decided against. Diodes will be on the actual expansion board. -Jeremy  

* Add diodes to uart receive pins

* check FTDI brown-on when unplugged - why the voltage?

* how to charge when robot is off? hold reset low, poweren high?

* measure standby current draw

Battery Currents:
0.06 mA When Robot is Off
180 mA when the robot is On but the processer is in Suspend
210 mA when the robot is on with nothing but the Idle (System, Heartbeat, Power) LEDs on.
210 mA when the robot is On with some LEDs (no Motors)
Cannot Test with Motors, Current Sense Meter Repeatadly Shuts Down Robot before motors start
