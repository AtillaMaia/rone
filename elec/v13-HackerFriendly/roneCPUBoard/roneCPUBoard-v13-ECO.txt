roneCPUBoard-v13ECO list

== TODO ==
* clean the cosmetics of the board even more (smaller vias)
* Fix the IR Beacons being Backwards
* Fix IR Beacon MOSFET needs to be NFET rather than PFET
* Scrub schematic comments (Sound de-pop resistor comment ref-desg)
* Turn ambient light sensor 45 degrees to point more towards outside
* Move resistor next to ambient light sensors a little so that it doesn't interfere with the light sensor folding down
* Think about replacing the SD card holder to a new design that won't get ripped off

* Make sure the next build is a V13, and make sure that V13 has all the changes


== Abandoned/Next Version ==

* make a four-layer board.

== Done ==
