roneMotorBoard-v11 ECO list

== Nnena & Chris ==


== James ==

* test CPU reset

* how to charge when robot is off? hold reset low, poweren high?




== done ==
* move power supply traces (bump 5 and vbat+300) to clear keep out on bottom right

* test MOSFET power down

* make VBAT trace going to main header bigger (jim frankel changes)

* move chrg away from bottom right keep out

* get rid of forks in I2C traces (jim frankel changes)

* change resistor on the VUSB line. 5k?

* add MOSFET to power bump sensors

* increase keepout size on top and bottom of PCB around screws and stand-offs.  The screw head shold not touch any traces, including groundplanes.
