Solidworks for Elecs Readme

//How to Prepare files for Elecs
Since Altium does coordinate systems and doesn't like objects at (0,0)
, it helpful to display key points in drawings using coordinates.
Solidworks doesn't have a native way to do this though some people 
recommend making a macro (i've had no luck). What I do is make a small 
circle 2" by 2" away from the lower left corner then make a drawing 
from the part. Then I do horizontal and vertical ordinate dimensions
on the key points. Sometimes it is helpful to draw a top layer sketch 
containing only points on key locations so that ordinate can work well.
Afterwards, make a note and click on the x coordinate then "," then 
click on the y coordinate. Do this for all the key points then 
hide/delete the ordinate dimensions. It's good to double check.
