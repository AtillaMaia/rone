Solidworks Licenses Readme
---------------------------------------------------------------------

//Renewal of Licenses
One solidworks license can be used by one person on two computers: 
personal and work. If you are unable to use the license then that 
means someone is already using it. If you call goengineer tech
support they will ask for your license (in the pdf) and then look up
who is using the license. The easiest way to transfer a license is to 
go to Solidworks on the computer they tell you then 
Help>Transfer Licenses. However if impossible then ask to start the 
deactivation process. The guy that handles our licenses is 
Arvind Krishnan <akrishnan@goengineer.com> contact him. Follow what 
he says and you are all good. It takes a day to do but the reps do
NOT like doing it so will try to avoid doing it. Good luck!
