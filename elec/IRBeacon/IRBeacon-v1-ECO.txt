Change and gate to or gate

Make OR gate in schematic. Remake SOT-23-5 footprint for it.

Make place for ID sticker

Add radio

Separate beacon control


==== completed items ====

Flip PFET across x-axis on PCB

Screw holes in corners (0.125)

Bigger board

Put current limiting resistors for indicator lights on bottom of board

Change pads on U1 footprint to be metric equivalent of 8 mil apart (They were fine, a constraint was wrong)

IR emitters 4 -> 2

Add power supply from Motor Board

Try extending GND plane over entire bottom board.

Change RGB diode/switch names

Reverse 3.3V and IR emitter on IR emitter header

Status LEDs and FTDI chip near USB connector

JTAG near chip, move other things to accomodate (leave space behind IR rcvr)

Top part = user interface

Fix library weirdness (for all of mrone)

Line up passives

Fix traces at IR emitters
