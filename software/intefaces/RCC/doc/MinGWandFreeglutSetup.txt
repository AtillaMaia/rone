This will run you how to setup MinGW and freeglut on Windows 7.

STEP 1: MinGW
First, download and install MinGW from the link below:
	http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/files/Installer/mingw-get-inst/mingw-get-inst-20111118/
	
[http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/files/Installer/mingw-get-inst/mingw-get-inst-20111118/ here]
	
Use the default directory ("C:\MinGW") because changing that can
screw up the installation and then Eclipse won't be able to find
it. Check the C Compiler and C++ Compiler. 


STEP 2: freeglut
Once that is installed, get the latest freeglut version for Windows
from here (get the MinGW Package):
	http://www.transmissionzero.co.uk/software/freeglut-devel/

Or you can get the source and compile your own package, but this 
isn't going to help with that. The pre-compiled archive works just
fine and is much simpler.

Once the you have unzipped the archive, do the following:
	1. Copy the freeglut.dll to "C:\Windows\System32"
	2. Copy the contents of include\GL to "C:\MinGW\include\GL"
	3. Copy the contents of lib to "C:\MinGW\lib"


STEP 3: Eclipse	(assuming you don't have it yet)
Now you just need Eclipse CDT. Get that from here:
	http://eclipse.org/downloads/

Extract it from the zip archive and place it where ever you want.
Start Eclipse and set the workspace to be "...\mrone\develcode" where
"..." is the path to the mrone repository on your computer. Now
everything should be setup and work correctly. Test this by importing
RoneGUI and doing a clean and build (right click on the project to 
bring up 'Clean Project' and 'Build Project') and then run 
(ctrl+F11). If the GUI comes up, then it worked. If not, double check
you did everything correctly above. If you did, continue to the 
project settings information (next step).


STEP 4: Project Settings
NOTE: If the GUI built and ran, you don't need to touch this. 

Right click on the project, go to 'Properties'. In the menu tree on
the far left, go to 'C/C++ Build' then to 'Settings'. In the new 
menu tree that showed up, go to 'MinGW C Linker' then 'Libraries'.

In libraries (-l), add (or make sure they are there) 
freeglut_static, opengl32, glu32, gdi32, and winmm. In
Library Search Path (-L), add "${workspace_loc:/OpenGLDemo/lib}" and
"C:\MinGW\lib". You DO want the quotes around the Search Path.

Now clean then build the project and try to run again. As long as
all of the above are in the libraries and Library Search Path,
it should run correctly. If it still fails, try to delete everything
that was done and try again.

To delete MinGW run the uninstaller in the MinGW folder and then
move the remnants of the folder to the trash. To delete Eclipse
just move the whole folder into the trash. To delete freeglut, just
remove the .dll from "C:\Windows\System32" as the rest was deleted
with MinGW.
