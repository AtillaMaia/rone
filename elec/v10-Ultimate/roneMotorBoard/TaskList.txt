* how to charge when robot is off? hold reset low, poweren high?



== done ==
* resize holes 

* Pull down/up address 0 select lines on the gyro and the accelerometer

* Pull down power_en to ground - power_en is disabled by default

* Why is the power button via larger than the other vias?  Is that for a wire or something? (fix via size)

* Center the main connector

* Add a 0.250 keep-out to the stand-off screws.  0.250" diameter should do it.

* remove reset from main connector

* remove as many traces as possible from underneath skirt sliders

* Add a ground test clip and a 3.3v connector to this board.

* Move the battery connector closer to the edge of the board, to improve the battery disconnection

* experiment with the test line: How can we use the other four pins for I/O?  The best lines to move here are the four rear bump sensors.

* add a testpoint to bump sensor #0 (front left) to bottom of board.  This is so we can probe it during class.

* there are resistors in the shell keep-out zone:  R47 for example

* add 0 ohm resistors or switch to change between rear bump sensors and JTAG

* move ref designators around on silk screen to not be over parts.  You will need to make an assembly drawing for some of the tight areas.

* Update and triple check the motor parts on the v9 board.

* route bump sensors

* route reset output to the MSP430 to rest of robot.
